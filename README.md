# IDEO Nomad Hackathon - 12.17.16

## Pre-hackathon Setup

Before the hackathon begins, you'll want to take the following steps:

### Install IPFS 

You will need IPFS to use Nomad. You can install the most up to date IPFS build [here](https://ipfs.io/).
It is a wonderful project and team, so we encourage you to learn about it as well!

### Install Node.js

Nomad is currently only written in Javascript and the hackathon will be Node.js-based. 
You can install the latest stable NodeJS build [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Clone This Repo

To familiarize you with Nomad, we'll do a live walkthrough and build a 
new Nomad node together at the beginning of the hackathon. 

The code we'll build upon is in this repo, so feel free to clone it locally and 
follow along with us in the live-demo introduction.
